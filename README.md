Thanks for joining this learning journey with us.

This repository documents my journey to getting better at anything by following the [first 20 hours challenge](https://first20hours.com/).
This is not sponsored. You can just check the Ted Talk at [this link](https://youtu.be/5MgBikgcWnY).

But, this is not just for me. You can also use this repository to document your journey and share it with the world.

    - Easy enough to be achievable
    - Ambitious enough to be interesting
    - Small enough to be achievable in 20 hours

I assure you that if you accomplish this, you will feel proud of yourself and be able to do anything you want.
